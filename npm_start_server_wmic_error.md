If %SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem is already in your PATH and you're still getting the ENOENT error, it's because wmic.exe has been deprecated and removed in recent versions of Windows 11 (24H2 and newer) and Windows Server. ðŸ˜ž
The start-server-and-test package likely relies on an unmaintained dependency that uses wmic.exe to check if a process is running. Since the file no longer exists by default on modern Windows versions, the command fails.
 
Solution
 
You can try to add the feature back to your system.
Add wmic as an Optional Feature:
Open Settings and go to Apps > Optional features.
Click "View features" to search for available features.
Search for WMIC. If it appears, check the box and install it.
Use PowerShell to Add the Capability:
Open PowerShell as an administrator.
Run the command: DISM /Online /Add-Capability /CapabilityName:WMIC~~~~
This will attempt to install the WMIC capability.
If neither of these works, the long-term solution is to use a different package that doesn't rely on wmic.exe or to find a way to configure start-server-and-test to use an alternative, such as PowerShell's Get-CimInstance or Get-WmiObject cmdlets, which have superseded wmic. Unfortunately, this may require a code change to the package itself or to a dependency.
